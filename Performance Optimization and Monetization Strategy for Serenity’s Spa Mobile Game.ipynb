Determine Indicators to Measure \"Good\" or \"Bad \"**\n\nBased on the available variables:\n\n- **Completion Rate**: A key variable as it indicates the proportion of players who successfully complete the level. A low completion rate could be an indication of too high difficulty or unintuitive design.\n- **Churn Rate**: An important variable as it reflects player retention. A high churn rate indicates the level is causing players to leave the game.\n- **Median Time to Complete**: Useful for assessing the duration of the level. A very long or very short time compared to the average could be a sign of the level being too easy or difficult.\n- **Average Attempts**: Indicates the number of times the player must try to complete the level. A high number of attempts could be a sign of a difficult level.\n- **Average Boosters Usage**: Measures the usage of boosters. High booster usage could signify the difficulty of the level without assistance.\n\n**Reasons Not All Variables Are Indicators**:\n- Not all variables have a direct relationship to play experience (e.g. number of unique players is not a direct indicator of level quality).\n- Relevant variables should reflect difficulty, player experience, and retention.\n\n\n### **2. Assessing Each Indicator**\n\nHere's how to score each indicator based on distribution and EDA:\n\n1. **Completion Rate**:\n   - Threshold: Industry average or internal data average.\n   - Level of **bad**: If Completion Rate < average - 1 standard deviation.\n   - Good** level: If the Completion Rate is close to 100%.\n\n2. **Churn Rate**:\n   - Threshold: The average churn rate of the data.\n   - Level of **bad**: If Churn Rate > average + 1 standard deviation.\n   - Good** level: If the Churn Rate is close to 0%.\n\n3. **Median Time to Complete**:\n   - Threshold: Average completion time ± tolerance (10-20% of average).\n   - Level **bad**: If the time is too long or too fast compared to the average.\n   - Good** level: If the time is within the tolerance range.\n\n4. **Average Attempts**:\n   - Threshold: Average attempts ± tolerance.\n   - **Worst** level: If the number of attempts > average + 1 standard deviation.\n   - **good** level: If the number of attempts is close to the average.\n\n5. **Average Boosters Usage**:\n   - Threshold: Average usage ± tolerance.\n   - **bad** level: If booster usage is much higher than average.\n   - **good** level: If booster usage is low but Completion Rate remains high.\n\n### Next Action**\n\n1. Calculate the indicators for each level using the right method.\n2. Identify levels with low scores as \"bad\" and high as \"good.\"\n3.

After launch, we got the following data:\n- Only 20% of all players who install the game participate in this feature\n- Before the feature was released, we had a DAU of 10,000 and Daily Revenue of 15,000$. After the feature is released, we boost our marketing campaign and increase our DAU to 25,000 and our Daily Revenue becomes 35,000.\n- Before the feature was released, players played our game for 1hr a day, and this does not change after we release the feature.\n\n#### Questions\n- What is the ARPDAU of the game?\n- Would you say this feature is a success? Explain your thought process\n- What will be your recommendation for improvement of this feature?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Serenity's Spa \"Leaderboard\" Feature Performance Analysis\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis report analyzes the performance of the recently launched \"Leaderboard\" feature in Serenity's Spa. The feature, accessible to players who have reached level 50, aimed to increase both playtime and revenue. To assess its effectiveness, we will examine the provided data, focusing on key metrics such as ARPDAU (Average Revenue Per Daily Active User) and user engagement.\n\n## Data Overview\n\n| Metric | Before Feature Launch | After Feature Launch |\n|---|---|---|\n| Feature Participation | Not Applicable | 20% of all players |\n| Daily Active Users (DAU) | 10,000 | 25,000 |\n| Daily Revenue | USD15,000 | USD35,000 |\n| Average Playtime | 1 hour per day | 1 hour per day |\n\nWhile the specific breakdown of revenue sources (e.g., in-app purchases, ads) is not available, it's important to consider the different ways the game generates revenue when analyzing the impact of the Leaderboard feature^1^.\n\n## ARPDAU Calculation and Analysis\n\nTo analyze the impact of the feature on revenue, we compared the ARPDAU before and after its launch^2^. ARPDAU is a crucial metric for evaluating the revenue generation capacity of a game on a per-user basis. It is calculated by dividing the total daily revenue by the number of daily active users.\n\n**Before Feature Launch:**\n\n- ARPDAU = USD15,000 / 10,000 users = $1.50\n\n**After Feature Launch:**\n\n- ARPDAU = USD35,000 / 25,000 users = $1.40\n\nSurprisingly, the ARPDAU slightly decreased after the feature launch and marketing campaign. This indicates that while the overall revenue increased, the revenue generated per user did not increase proportionally with the rise in DAU. The decrease in ARPDAU could indicate that users are either spending less overall or that their spending habits have shifted since the introduction of the Leaderboard.\n\n## Feature Impact Assessment\n\nTo accurately assess the \"Leaderboard\" feature's impact, we need to isolate its effects from the influence of the marketing campaign. Considering that only 20% of players engaged with the feature, we can estimate its contribution to the DAU and revenue increase as follows:\n\n- **DAU Increase Attributable to the Feature:** 25,000 (total DAU) * 20% = 5,000 users\n\n- **DAU Increase Attributable to Marketing:** 25,000 (total DAU) - 10,000 (initial DAU) - 5,000 (feature-related DAU) = 10,000 users\n\nThis analysis reveals that the marketing campaign played a more significant role in driving the overall DAU increase than the Leaderboard feature itself.\n\nAnalyzing the revenue increase is more complex without specific data on in-app purchases or spending habits related to the \"Leaderboard\" feature. It's crucial to understand how different user segments, particularly those engaged with the Leaderboard, contribute to overall revenue^3^. However, the decrease in ARPDAU suggests that the feature might not be directly driving a substantial increase in revenue per user.\n\n## Feature Success Evaluation\n\nTo evaluate the success of the Leaderboard feature, we considered both the revenue increase and the percentage of players actively using it^4^. Based on the available data, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether the \"Leaderboard\" feature is a success. While the overall DAU and revenue increased, these increases appear largely driven by the marketing campaign. Furthermore, the feature's low participation rate (20%) and the decrease in ARPDAU raise concerns about its effectiveness in driving monetization.\n\n## Recommendations for Improvement\n\nTo enhance the \"Leaderboard\" feature and potentially boost its impact on playtime and revenue, we recommend the following improvements:\n\n- **Increase Feature Visibility and Appeal:** Promote the Leaderboard more prominently within the game to attract more players. This could involve in-game notifications, highlighting top players, or showcasing Leaderboard rewards^5^.\n\n- **Incentivize Participation:** Introduce rewards or exclusive benefits for players who actively engage with the Leaderboard. This could include in-game currency, unique items, or cosmetic upgrades^6^.\n\n- **Enhance Competitiveness:** Consider implementing tiered leaderboards, time-limited competitions, or special events to foster a more competitive environment and encourage ongoing engagement^7^.\n\n- **Gamify the Experience:** Integrate elements of gamification, such as progress bars, achievements, or challenges, to make the Leaderboard more interactive and rewarding^8^.\n\n- **Personalization:** Allow players to customize their Leaderboard profiles, track their progress over time, and compare their performance with friends or other players with similar skill levels^9^.\n\n## Industry Benchmarks and Playtime Considerations\n\nWhile specific industry benchmarks for ARPDAU in casual games vary, data suggests that ARPDAU for hyper-casual games ranges from USD0.10 to USD0.12^10^.([https://blogs.geniteam.com/arpdau-games/](https://blogs.geniteam.com/arpdau-games/)) Serenity's Spa, with an ARPDAU of $1.40 after the feature launch, appears to be performing well above this benchmark. However, it's crucial to compare these figures with benchmarks for similar spa or simulation games for a more accurate assessment. For instance, data from GameAnalytics indicates that in 2019, the ARPDAU for Role Playing and Strategy games was significantly higher than other genres, converting 5-7x more than casual games^11^. This highlights the importance of considering genre-specific benchmarks when evaluating the game's performance.\n\nTo increase playtime alongside revenue, consider the following strategies:\n\n- **Content Updates:** Regularly introduce new content, such as spa treatments, decorations, or storylines, to keep players engaged and provide fresh challenges^12^.\n\n- **Social Features:** Encourage social interaction by allowing players to visit each other's spas, exchange gifts, or participate in cooperative challenges^13^.\n\n- **Events and Challenges:** Introduce time-limited events or daily challenges with attractive rewards to incentivize regular playtime^14^.\n\n- **Progression Systems:** Implement a clear and rewarding progression system that motivates players to continue playing and unlock new content^15^.\n\nThese strategies, combined with improvements to the Leaderboard feature, can create a more engaging and rewarding experience for players, potentially leading to increased playtime and revenue.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe \"Leaderboard\" feature in Serenity's Spa has shown mixed results. While the overall DAU and revenue have increased, these improvements appear largely driven by the marketing campaign rather than the feature itself. The relatively low participation rate and the decrease in ARPDAU suggest that the Leaderboard may not be effectively driving monetization or significantly impacting user spending habits.\n\nHowever, by implementing the recommendations outlined in this report, such as increasing feature visibility, incentivizing participation, and enhancing competitiveness, Serenity's Spa can improve the Leaderboard's appeal and encourage greater user engagement. Additionally, focusing on content updates, social features, and a rewarding progression system can further enhance the player experience and potentially drive increased playtime and revenue.\n\nFurther analysis of user segmentation based on Leaderboard engagement and a deeper understanding of player spending patterns would provide valuable insights for optimizing the feature and maximizing its impact on key performance indicators. By continuously monitoring and iterating on the Leaderboard feature, Serenity's Spa can unlock its full potential and achieve its goals of increased playtime and revenue.\n\n#### Reference List\n\n1. 4 Ways Feature Requests Could Impact Revenue | Amoeboids, accessed on December 13, 2024, [https://amoeboids.com/blog/estimating-the-revenue-potential-for-your-feature-requests/](https://amoeboids.com/blog/estimating-the-revenue-potential-for-your-feature-requests/)\n2.

Explain your thought process\n3. What insight can we get from player’s purchase behavior from this AB test?\n4. Suppose we want to run another AB test, what changes would you suggest?\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **A. Statistical Validity of A/B Test**\n1. **Sample Distribution and Randomisation:**\n   - Total players: 2.500\n   - Control: 1,224 players\n   - Variant: 1,276 players\n   \n   The sample split between the Control and Variant groups was relatively even. This is in accordance with optimal practice in A/B testing, where both groups should be close to equal in size to minimise bias and increase statistical power (Kohavi et al., 2007; Kohavi & Thomke, 2017).\n\n2. **Test Duration:**\n   - The test runs for 1 week. While 1 week may provide an initial indication, some literature suggests a longer duration to capture long-term behavioural variations (Kohavi & Longbotham, 2017). However, as a first step, this duration is acceptable to at least get an initial signal.\n\n3. **Available Data and Significance Tests:**\n   - The data presented includes the number of unique buyers, total transactions, and price per IAP.  \n   - To test the significance of the change in conversion, we can perform a simple proportion z-test on the conversion of the item with the most obvious difference, such as IAP-1.  \n   \n   **Example Test (IAP-1 Conversion):**\n   - Conversion on Control for IAP-1: 44 unique buyers out of 1,224 players → Conversion rate ≈ 3.6%.  \n   - Conversion on Variant for IAP-1: 70 unique buyers out of 1,276 players → Conversion rate ≈ 5.5%.  \n   \n   Intuitively, the increase from 3.6% to 5.5% is considerable. References in online experiments (Kohavi et al., 2007) state that measurable and replicable differences in conversion rates generally indicate test validity.\n\n**Conclusion of Validity:**\nMethodologically, this A/B test can be considered valid. The group split was balanced, the minimum duration was met, and there were indications of significant conversion changes in the key item (IAP-1). However, the total revenue analysis would be more robust if supported by per-user data as well as more in-depth statistical tests (Kohavi & Thomke, 2017).\n\n\n### **B. Was the A/B Test a Success?**\n1. **Main Objective:**\n   Hypothesis: Lowering prices will increase conversions, and ultimately increase total revenue.\n\n2. **Total Revenue Comparison:**\n   - Control (total estimate): ±\\$1,074\n   - Variant (total estimate): ±\\$1,164\n   \n   An increase of about \\$90 or about +8.4%. Whilst not huge, it is still a positive increase.\n\n3. **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User):**\n   - Control: ±\\$0.877\n   - Variant: ±\\$0.912\n   \n   ARPU increased by approximately \\$0.035 per player, indicating that the average revenue per player is slightly higher in Variant.\n\n4. **Significant IAP-1 Conversion:**\n   - The significant difference in conversion on IAP-1 supports the hypothesis that lower prices encourage more players to purchase. According to the theory of price and demand, lowering price barriers can increase the number of buyers (Mankiw, 2018, pp. 448).\n\n**Conclusion of Success:**\nFrom the perspective of the original objectives (increasing conversions and total revenue), there are indications of success. Although the increase was not very dramatic, the results were as expected: conversions went up, total revenue went up, and ARPU also increased moderately. This can be considered an initial success that supports the hypothesis.\n\n\n### **C. Insights from Player Behaviour:**\n1. **Price Sensitivity on High-Value Items:**\n   - IAP-1 (Permanent Upgrade) shows the clearest conversion response. The price drop on permanent items increased the number of unique buyers significantly. This suggests that players are price-sensitive on items with long-term value.\n\n2. **Volume vs. Margin:**\n   - Despite the price drop, an increase in overall purchase volume can offset lower margins, resulting in increased total revenue. This is in line with the concept of price elasticity, where lowering prices can increase total demand (Mankiw, 2018, pp. 90-95).\n\n3. **Preference for a \"Good Deal\":**\n   - Players appear to respond positively when they feel they are getting a more affordable deal. This also reflects the importance of perceived value in purchase decision-making.\n\n\n### **D. Suggestions for Future A/B Tests:**\n1. **Extend Test Duration:**\n   - Run the test longer (2 weeks or more) so that the results are more stable and representative of medium-term behavioural patterns (Kohavi & Longbotham, 2017).\n\n2. **Segmentation Based on Player Profile:**\n   - Analyses based on player types (e.g. active players, new players, old players) can reveal which segments are most responsive to price changes (Deng et al., 2013).\n\n3. **Focus on One IAP or Different Price Variations:**\n   - Try a test that specifically focuses on 1 IAP (e.g. IAP-1) with multiple price variants to map price elasticity and find the optimal price point (Leeflang et al., 2015, pp. 2-4).\n\n4. **Test Bundling:**\n   - Consider not only lowering prices, but also reorganising bundled offerings so that players experience greater \"value\" at prices that are slightly higher but still cheaper than the initial offering (Mankiw, 2018, pp. 426-428)...\n\n5. **Deeper Statistical Analyses:**\n   - Use non-parametric testing methods (e.g. permutation tests) or bootstrapping on granular (per-user) data to increase confidence in statistical inferences (Deng et al., 2013).\n\n\n**References:**\n- Deng, A., et al.
