### Overview Headline:  
**Improving Player Engagement and Revenue Generation Through Data-Driven Insights for Serenity’s Spa**

### Overview:  
This project analyzed the performance of Serenity's Spa mobile game, identifying key areas for improving player engagement, retention, and revenue. Through data analysis of player progress, in-game purchases, and user behavior, this project provided actionable insights and recommendations aimed at enhancing game features and optimizing monetization strategies.

### Data Details:  
- **Source**: Player data extracted from Serenity's Spa mobile game, including level progression, in-app purchases, and leaderboard interactions.  
- **Size**: 120 records across various levels, user interactions, and purchases  
- **Key Variables**:  
  - Level and Sub-level  
  - Completion and Churn Rates  
  - Average Attempts and Booster Usage  
  - Daily Active Users (DAU)  
  - In-App Purchases (IAP) and ARPDAU (Average Revenue Per Daily Active User)

### Problem Statement:  
The game was facing challenges with player retention and monetization. Specific levels were hindering player progression, while newly introduced features like the leaderboard were underperforming in terms of engagement and revenue. The task was to analyze the current data to uncover actionable insights that could address these challenges.

### Solution:  
1. **Level Funnel Analysis**: A detailed examination of completion rates and drop-off points at various levels to identify problematic levels.
2. **Leaderboard Feature Evaluation**: An analysis of the impact of the newly launched leaderboard on DAU, revenue, and player engagement.
3. **AB Test Evaluation**: A statistical analysis of a pricing test for in-app purchases to assess its effect on conversion rates and overall revenue.

### Insight:  
- **Problematic Levels**: Specific levels with low completion rates and high churn were identified, particularly those with difficult difficulty curves or requiring excessive booster usage.  
- **Leaderboard Feature Impact**: While the leaderboard increased DAU and revenue, its ARPDAU slightly decreased, indicating that the feature did not significantly impact player spending.  
- **AB Test Results**: The pricing change in the AB test resulted in a modest increase in total revenue (+8.4%) and ARPU, validating the hypothesis that lowering prices could increase conversions.

### Recommendation:  
1. **Improve Level Design**: Redesign levels with low completion rates by reducing complexity, offering better player guidance, and optimizing difficulty curves.
2. **Enhance Leaderboard Engagement**: Increase the visibility of the leaderboard, offer exclusive rewards, and gamify the experience to attract more users and boost participation.
3. **Future AB Tests**: Extend test durations to capture long-term behaviors and experiment with more granular pricing strategies or bundle offerings to further optimize conversion and revenue.
